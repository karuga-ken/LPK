                        <p>Start by ensuring that your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond your planned stay.
                             Next, obtain a visa. Depending on the nature of your internship, you may need either a Tourist Visa, which typically 
                             allows for a stay of up to 90 days, or a Student/Internship Visa, which is more specific to internship purposes. 
                              Additionally, check whether you need any vaccinations 
                             or health certificates to enter Kenya. Lastly, itâ€™s important to have travel
                             insurance that covers medical emergencies e.t.c.

                        LPK does not offer paid internships because it is a non-profit organization and cannot finance such positions.  
                       </p>

                       Your length of stay is whatever you are available for and can be decided on an individual basis. A minimum of 4 weeks is
                        recommended to ensure you are able to experience all that LPK has to offer and to give you time to work on your project.

                       Depending on the size of the group and availability, accommodation can be provided at the intern house which is
                        located near LPK'S office in Matasia. You are also welcome to seek out your own accommodation in the area.

                       The costs of interning will come from your accommodation, food, flights, and daily transportation to and from work. There is a daily rate to stay at the LPK Intern house which includes breakfast and supper.
                        Also, factor in any sightseeing or additional trips you want to make while in the country.
