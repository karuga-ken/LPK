          The OVC Programâ€™s creation goes back to the start when Mum began cooking for and feeding the women in the slums. Children began to gather at the site where she was cooking. Many of these children were as young as 2 years old, but they had nobody to supervise them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although the vision originally was to provide for these women and their children, Mum realized that these extremely young children had no other options for safe places to go while their parents were working and their siblings were in school.

            <p className='text-left font-thin text-sm sm:text-base'>
              Salama School houses classrooms for children from 3-6 years old. Many of the students are children of women in WEEP. There is also a daycare attached to the school. Salama offers the children a safe place during the day while their parents are either working or taking part in WEEP.
